Green anacondas are one of the largest snakes in the world. Normally, they are solitary creatures and stay within their own hunting area. Reports of anaconda attacks on humans are rare. However, these boas can take down large prey, including jaguars.
Green anacondas live in streams, rivers, swamps, and marshes. They are found throughout tropical South America, mainly in the Amazon and Orinoco basins.
Green anacondas are carnivores who eat any animal they can catch! That includes large rodents, tapirs, capybaras, deer, peccaries, fish, turtles, birds, sheep, dogs, and aquatic reptiles. They are ambush predators who wait very still to surprise their prey until it gets close enough for the anaconda to strike. They grab their prey with their teeth and powerful jaws before wrapping their strong, muscular bodies around their prey. They constrict and squeeze their prey hard and long so when the prey breathes out, the snake can tighten its grip even more so the prey cannot breathe in.
Like other boa species, anacondas are ovoviviparous, or birth live young. Clutch, or group of eggs, and birth size are proportional to the femaleâ€™s size. A clutch could include up to 50 young anacondas ranging from two to three feet in length. The baby snakes can swim and hunt shortly after birth.

All buildings being designed are incorporating LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards and being built with sustainable principles in mind, including recycling waste construction material whenever possible. Some of our green building initiatives include:

The bathrooms in the middle of the Zoo include large windows to provide significant natural lighting during daylight hours, while LED lights were installed for additional lighting when needed.
Modulating condensing natural gas boilers throughout the zoo. These boilers increase combustion efficiency to about 96%, up from 80% efficiency in non-condensing boilers.
Geothermal heat used in the Red Barn.
New glass with a high insulation value was installed in the Rhino Barn.
Automatic water-saving faucets and electric hand dryers for reduced paper use were installed in the bathrooms.
A water bottle filling station was installed to cut down on guest use of disposable water bottles.
50% of our lawn areas have been converted back to the original woodland cover.
